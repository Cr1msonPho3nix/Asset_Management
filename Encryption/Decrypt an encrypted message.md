# Scenario
In this scenario, all of the files in your home directory have been encrypted. Youâ€™ll need to use Linux commands to break the Caesar cipher and decrypt the files so that you can read the hidden messages they contain.

## 1. Read the contents of a file
- In this task, you need to explore the contents of your home directory and read the contents of a file to get further instructions. The README.txt file contains an important message with instructions you need to follow.<br><br>

<br>

## 2. Find a hidden file
- In this task, you need to find a hidden file in your home directory and decrypt the Caesar cipher it contains. This task will enable you to complete the next task.
- This cipher can be solved by shifting each alphabet character to the left or right by a fixed number of spaces. In this example, the shift is three letters to the left. Thus "d" stands for "a", and "e" stands for "b". [tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"]<br><br>

## 3. Decrypt a file
- In this task you need to use the command revealed in .leftshift3 to decrypt a file and recover your data so you can read the message it contains. Use the information on the text previously decrypted.<br><br>
